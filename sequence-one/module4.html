            <ul>
                <li>Molecular homology as evidence of relatedness between species including DNA and amino acid sequences, mtDNA (the molecular clock) and the DNA hybridisation technique.</li>

            <h4>Student learning outcomes</h4>
            <p>On completion of this module, students will:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Apply their understanding on phylogeny to construct a phylogenetic tree</li>
                <li>Understand how phylogeny can inform decisions made by industries and that address conservation issues</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <h4>Module description</h4>
    <p>There are many conventions when constructing a phylogenetic tree that are often misinterpreted by students. During the sequence outline, some of the misconceptions related to interpreting phylogenetic trees were pointed out. It is suggested that they are addressed directly through student assessment and teacher clarifications.</p>
    <p>In this final module, students are going to apply their understanding of phylogenetic trees by building two of them, using morphological data in the first activity and molecular data in the second. The latter was designed in the context of recent research developed by Deakin University, following up on the subject of plants with medicinal properties. The module ends with a final interview video with the PhD researcher whose project inspired this learning sequence. </p>

        <p>This article contains instructions to conduct an introductory activity to construct phylogenetic trees. It is recommended that students undertake this activity in small groups to allow for discussion. The activity allows for the 	construction of a phylogenetic tree using morphological traits only. The teacher should guide the students to use parsimony when developing trees, choosing the one that explains relatedness between all organisms in the shortest evolutionary pathway. </p>

        </ul>
        <p>This designed activity was inspired by current research in phylogeny and shows some of the applications to modern society. More specifically, the activity addresses the interest of the pharmaceutical industry in finding a species with the greatest likelihood of presenting medicinal properties, which can be inferred from its relatedness to known medicinal plants. Students can use the supporting information below to learn more about the Tasmanian mountain pepper, the activity’s protagonist. Additional information can be found on other plants used by Aboriginal communities in south-eastern Australia, a valuable source of ethnobotany and celebration of Aboriginal knowledge.</p>

        <p style="max-width: 100%;">In this final interview, PhD student (as of January 2018) talks about her research project in phylogeny and what her main activities as a researcher were. She summarises some of her main results and their possible implications to the pharmaceutical industry and conservation decisions. This is an excellent opportunity for students to learn more about the daily activities of a researcher and break some stereotypes about research activities. As opposed to what some students might expect, not all researchers spend their days doing lab work. This interview also wraps up student learning on what phylogeny is and what research in phylogenetics is for.</p>
