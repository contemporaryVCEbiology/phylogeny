    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <h4>Module description</h4>
    <p>This section introduces biogeography as one of the types of evidence for evolution. Biogeography is currently used to investigate conservation and phylogenetic issues, especially related to climate change. Researchers might ask, for example, “What is the impact of the rise of temperature in the oceans on the distribution of corals in the Great Barrier Reef?” or “What are the key species and/or key geographical characteristics that help buffer the effects of climate change?” Both these questions have direct impact on conservation planning that may help us preserve vulnerable environments from climate change.</p>
    <p>In conjunction with phylogenetic studies and palaeontology, biogeography can be a tool for reconstructing the evolutionary history of organisms and help explain how they came to be where they are. It is important to note that, since it is impossible to rewind historical processes, biogeographic scenarios have to be inferred from the data available, which are at times contradicting. Because of that, such scenarios are constructed through probability studies, and are constantly changing as new data and improved research tools are made available.</p>
    <p>In this module, students will apply their knowledge of biogeography and ethnobotany to explain how Aloe vera acquired its economic popularity, engaging with a unique resource inspired by current research in biogeography. Students will also have the opportunity to learn from videos where scientist Matthew Symonds discusses about research in biogeography and what it is like to be a researcher in the field. This lesson focuses on the applicability of biogeography as a field of research.</p>

Article	Anthropology is far from licking the problem of fossil ages 
https://aeon.co/ideas/anthropology-is-far-from-licking-the-problem-of-fossil-ages
This article discusses some of the limitations of fossil-dating in light of a controversial hominid fossil found in 2015. After briefly becoming aware of major dating methods, students can contemplate some difficulties in palaeontology. A whole-class discussion is suggested to comment on the challenges and validity of palaeontological discoveries.

    <h4>Activities</h4>
    <div class="activity">
        <p>Activity 2.1 - <strong>Geological changes on Earth</strong> (10-20 minutes)</p>
        <h5>Whole class discussion</h5>
        <p>If possible, bring a globe to encourage discussion. Point out the resemblance between the borders of Africa and South America and ask students about Pangea. Engaging with student understanding about tectonic plates, discuss how continents might be moving, mentioning the term “continental drift”. This alternative is good for assessing students’ prior knowledge.</p>
        <h5>Think-pair-share</h5>
        <p>In pairs, students will engage with the questions while visualizing a world map: Has the world always been like this? How is it changing? Why is Australia a country with an unproportioned number of marsupials, if compared to other countries? Students should conduct independent research and share their findings with their colleague. This alternative offers all students the opportunity to contribute to the topic.</p>

        <p>Activity 1.2 - <strong>Pangaea and Continental drift</strong> (10-20 minutes)</p>
        <h5>Whole class discussion</h5>
        <p>With the intention of refreshing students’ memory on geophysics, this activity aims at articulating student understanding on how continental drift may have affected living organisms. </p>
        <h5>Small group discussion</h5>
        <p>Separated into small groups, students engage with the handout provided (appendix 1). Teachers should mediate student discussion while assessing prior knowledge during the activity, making sure students are dedicating a deep level of thought into the questions. For question 5 in the handout, teachers will be required to share an image with students, provided in appendix 2.</p>
        <p>The following resources can also be used to learn more about the theory of continental drift. The videos, specifically, can be a useful resource to share with students and increase their engagement in the subject. Activity 3 is suggested for students who have never learnt about continental drift before, with a series of resources offered by the Nuttfield Foundation.</p>
