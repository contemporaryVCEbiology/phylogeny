    <h3>Teacher background information</h3>
    <h4>Module description</h4>
    <p>This section introduces biogeography as one of the types of evidence for evolution. Biogeography is currently used to investigate conservation and phylogenetic issues, especially related to climate change. Researchers might ask, for example, “What is the impact of the rise of temperature in the oceans on the distribution of corals in the Great Barrier Reef?” or “What are the key species and/or key geographical characteristics that help buffer the effects of climate change?” Both these questions have direct impact on conservation planning that may help us preserve vulnerable environments from climate change.</p>
    <p>In conjunction with phylogenetic studies and palaeontology, biogeography can be a tool for reconstructing the evolutionary history of organisms and help explain how they came to be where they are. It is important to note that, since it is impossible to rewind historical processes, biogeographic scenarios have to be inferred from the data available, which are at times contradicting. Because of that, such scenarios are constructed through probability studies, and are constantly changing as new data and improved research tools are made available.</p>
    <p>In this module, students will apply their knowledge of biogeography and ethnobotany to explain how Aloe vera acquired its economic popularity, engaging with a unique resource inspired by current research in biogeography. Students will also have the opportunity to learn from videos where scientist Matthew Symonds discusses about research in biogeography and what it is like to be a researcher in the field. This lesson focuses on the applicability of biogeography as a field of research.</p>

In a circle, promote a whole-class discussion about the benefits of the plant, writing a list of benefits on the whiteboard. This will serve to both acknowledge and value student previous knowledge and to present a link between science and students’ daily lives.

        <p>This activity was designed to assist with learning about biogeography and ethnobotany using recent research in the field. It starts with a brief explanation of divergent and convergent evolution to engage students, and it follows with the case of Aloe vera, where students will analyse its biogeographical scenario and make inferences from the results of the study. They will then attempt to answer the research question: Why is Aloe vera the most commercially available species of the genus Aloe? Students will be given a handout with the activity and the proposed exercises. It should take them 20-30 minutes to complete the activity. Teachers should guide students through new concepts, possibly keeping a glossary on the whiteboard, and promote a whole-class discussion on the main conclusions of the research.</p>

        <p style="max-width: 100%;">In this interview, Dr. Symonds discusses the uses of indigenous knowledge (IK) in studies of phylogeny, and more specifically describes what ethnobotany is. By citing some works in which IK was used, he celebrates Aboriginal knowledge and acknowledges it. This will serve to wrap up student understanding on the previous activity and consolidate knowledge. It may also be an opportunity to introduce aspects of human evolution, also using the article discussed in Part 1 of this module.</p>
