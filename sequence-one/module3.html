    <h1>What evidence can we use to show relatedness between species?</h1>
    <p class="intro">The first module within Section 2 focuses on identifying the main evidence used to determine relatedness between species, listing some of the data collected by phylogenists and describing the DNA hybridisation technique. This module is expected to take 2 hours of class time.</p>

    <h2>Teacher background information</h2>
    <h3>Module description</h3>
    <p>Phylogenetics is the study of the evolutionary history and the relationships between groups of organisms. It involves the collection of morphological, behavioural and molecular (DNA, RNA, amino acid) data, to then compare the number of similarities or differences between them and use this information to construct phylogenetic trees.</p> 
    <p>Because behavioural data is analysed when discerning one species from another, there are species that are morphologically alike, but are considered different species because they live in different habitats and have different behavioural patterns, such as sexual selection choices or migratory preferences. Although this concept is often hard to grasp, it fits well into our most accepted understanding of what a species is: Organisms of the same group that can procreate and generate viable, fertile offspring. It is important to note, however, that there are cases where members of different species that were close enough could produce fertile hybrids, such as in orchids, salamanders (Fapesp, 2011) and even wallabies (Close &amp; Bell, 1997).</p>
    <p>Before the advent of DNA technologies, biologists used mainly morphological and behavioural traits to determine relatedness between species. One of the most revolutionary use of molecular data in phylogeny happened in 1977, when Carl Woese and George Fox published an article separating living organisms in three major groups (eubacteria, eukaryotes and archaebacteria) using small subunits of rRNA. Molecular data is often considered more reliable for constructing phylogenetic trees, being less prone to convergence evolution. This has recently been reiterated by an article published by Nature in 2016, when authors Zou and Zhang compared characters used in mammal phylogeny and proposed a way to increase validity of morphological data by ignoring convergence-prone traits. Despite the apparent advantage of molecular over morphological data, the latter is not, and should not, be disregarded. As Wiens (2004) argues, morphological data is relevant for a number of reasons, including the need to include fossil record on phylogenetic trees (p. 653).</p>
    <p>In this module, students will consider the main forms of evidence used when determining relatedness between species and they will learn the key words in phylogeny.</p>

        <h5>Which information would you use to group organisms? (10-15 min)</h5>
        <p>In an attempt to assess student prior knowledge, choose five organisms and promote a whole-class discussion on which sources of data could be valuable when determining relatedness between species. For example, when comparing mammals, would the coat-colour be a relevant trait? Or perhaps the eating habits (herbivore, carnivore)? Which characteristics matter more when grouping organisms and why? How 	would you know if a black panther is more closely related to a black bear than to a tiger? Extending on this discussion, challenge students to represent the relatedness between the chosen organisms, with an explanation of their diagram. Alternatively to the whole-class discussion, separate students into small groups to develop their ideas and make sure everyone will participate. Students may also write an anonymous contribution to the topic in case they have difficulties sharing their opinions.</p>

        <p>Activity 1</p>
        <h5>Debate: Morphological or Molecular traits? (20-30 min)</h5>
        <p>Students are given resources to study the contribution of molecular data to 	phylogenetic studies, which they can independently research on their computers or use handouts provided by teachers with main information to support the debate. The class is divided in two and students should know which side they are going to defend 	prior to their research. One side should support the sole use of molecular data to 	reconstruct trees, while the other side argues for the inclusion of morphological traits. Each member of both groups should be encouraged to participate, having 2-3 min to make their point and respond to their opponent’s arguments. The length of this activity will depend on how many students there are, and on how much time will be given to the study of supporting arguments for the debate.</p>

        <p>Activity 2</p>
        <h5>Representational challenge: Create a resource explaining DNA hybridisation (20-30 min)</h5>
        <p>In this activity, students are challenged to create their own representation of the DNA 	hybridisation process. It is suggested that teachers attempt to create the representation prior to the class to both become familiar with the process and to offer their creation as an example of what can be done by students. Ideally the 	representational challenge would involve the use of ICT (Information and Communication Technologies).</p>
        <p>Possible forms of representation include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Animation</li>
            <li>Slowmation (as specified in Section 1, Module 1, Activity 5)</li>
            <li>Use of materials such as sticks, paper and play dough</li>
            <li>Drawings</li>
        </ul>
        <p>More information on how to scaffold students on representational challenges can be found at: <a class="new-tab-warning" href="http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30069215/hubber-representation-post-2014.pdf" target="_blank">http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30069215/hubber-representation-post-2014.pdf</a> (Hubber, 2014)</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Students can be offered the resources available in the teacher’s additional information section to inspire their debate.</p>
