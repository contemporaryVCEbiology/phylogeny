                        <p>I am an evolutionary ecologist who is interested in trying to explain, from an evolutionary perspective, what has generated differences in behaviour, ecology, morphology (body shape) and physiology between closely related species. I use evolutionary trees to answer questions about why particular traits have evolved. Using this approach, I have investigated the evolution of traits as diverse as insect sex pheromones, reptile colour patterns, mammal metabolic rates, bird beak sizes and plant medicinal capacity. I have been a lecturer at Deakin University for 7 years, teaching evolution and statistics. I am also the editor-in-chief of the journal Evolutionary Ecology. <a class="full-profile" href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/about-deakin/people/matthew-symonds" target="_blank">Full profile</a></p>

                        <p>I am a PhD student at Centre for Integrative Ecology at Deakin University. My research interest is in understanding the evolutionary relationships of plant taxa. The current PhD research I am conducting is about using phylogeny to predict medicinal utility of Magnoliids, which is an Australasian spice clade. In this research I am trying to use chemical similarity between closely related taxa as an indicator to predict medicinal properties of Magnoliids. The fact that evolutionary related species exhibit similar characteristics fascinates me. Therefore, in my research work I try to explain medicinal properties of plants in the light of evolutionary biology.</p>
